Wangyou Zhang is currently an Assistant Professor at [School of Artificial Intelligence (SAI)](https://soai.sjtu.edu.cn), Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU). He received his Ph.D. degree at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2024, under the supervision of Professor [Yanmin Qian](https://audiocc.sjtu.edu.cn/en/members/yanmin.qian). He serves as a regular reviewer of top-tier journals and conferences, including TASLP<d-footnote>TASLP: IEEE/ACM Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing</d-footnote>, SPL<d-footnote>SPL: IEEE Signal Processing Letters</d-footnote>, Speech Communication, ICASSP<d-footnote>ICASSP: IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing</d-footnote>, Interspeech, and so on. He received the Best Paper Awards in EMNLP 2024 and ASRU 2019, and the Best Reviewer Award in ASRU 2023. He received the [Microsoft Fellowship](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/articles/eleven-phd-students-are-awarded-the-2021-microsoft-research-asia-fellowship-award/) (one of eleven in the Asia-Pacific region annually) in 2021. He has also been actively contributing to open-source projects, especially [ESPnet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet) (one of the most popular end-to-end speech processing toolkits), where he has been one of the core contributors since 2020.

His current research interest focuses on **speech signal processing in complex scenarios**, including speech enhancement and separation, robust speech recognition, and self-supervised speech pre-training. He has published over 40 papers (17 first-authored) in top-tier speech conferences and journals on these research topics, including TASLP, SPM<d-footnote>SPM: Signal Processing Magazine</d-footnote>, ICASSP, and Interspeech.
